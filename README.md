[train.csv]() and [test.csv]() comprise the entire dataset. Code can produce output CSV or split the training set to get a validation accuracy for the respective permutation of algorithms and hyperparameters. 

--- 
For latest submitted code, see [main.ipynb](https://github.com/latentghost/SML_Project/blob/main/main.ipynb). CSVs are named after the accuracies produced.  
Use [test.ipynb](https://github.com/latentghost/SML_Project/blob/main/test.ipynb) to compare CSVs with newly generated output from *main.ipynb*.
